# Velocity Experiment

## Objective
This is an experiment used to validate the genetic algorithm. Since we can predict that ants with a greater velocity increase the fitness score (food brought to the anthill), we expect that the genetic algorithm will evolve the ants in this direction.

## Ant's parameters 
- Velocity
  Default value : 0.0004
  Lower Bound : 0.0002
  Upper Bound : 0.002
  The default value of the ant's velocity is 0.0004 and it ranges in the interval [0.0002, 0.002]
